# From Beat to Flight

### Music-Driven Drone Choreography for Expressive Human–Drone Interaction

---

## Overview

**From Beat to Flight** explores how Music Information Retrieval (MIR) can dynamically program expressive drone movements for performance and human–drone interaction (HDI).

Instead of manually scripting aerial choreography, this project investigates how musical structure — tempo, pitch, rhythm, timbre, and harmonic features — can be computationally parsed and translated into meaningful drone behaviors.

The long-term vision is to enable drones to function as:

* 🎵 Expressive aerial dancers
* 🤝 Human dance partners
* 🌊 Swarm-based embodied music environments

This project contributes a **music–drone–movement design space**, a technical mapping framework, and a series of empirical studies examining how humans perceive, co-create, and move with music-responsive drones.

## Research Goals

1. Define a **Music–Drone–Movement Design Space**
2. Develop a real-time MIR-to-drone mapping pipeline
3. Evaluate drone expressivity and perceived musicality
4. Investigate drones as embodied co-dancers
5. Explore swarm behavior as immersive music-responsive environments

# Music–Drone–Movement Mapping Space

The core technical contribution is a structured mapping between MIR features and drone motion parameters.

| MIR Feature        | Drone Parameter                | Expressive Rationale                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Tempo (BPM)        | Velocity                       | Faster tempo → increased motion energy |
| Beat Onset         | Acceleration pulses            | Perceived rhythmic synchronization     |
| Pitch Height       | Altitude                       | High pitch → elevated position         |
| Harmonic Tension   | Proximity to human             | Dissonance → spatial tension           |
| Spectral Energy    | Swarm density                  | High energy → tighter formation        |
| Timbre Brightness  | LED color intensity            | Brighter timbre → higher luminance     |
| Polyphony          | Number of active drones        | Each track → one expressive agent      |
| Amplitude Envelope | Vertical oscillation amplitude | Dynamic shaping of motion              |

## Mapping Paradigms

### 1:1 Mapping

Monophonic channel → Single drone

### Hierarchical Mapping

Bass → grounding drone
Melody → lead expressive drone
Percussion → high-frequency motion drones

### Swarm Mapping

Multi-track music → distributed drone ensemble
